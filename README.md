## Contents

The `@grail/lib` module holds both utility functions and constants used across GRAIL applications.

**ALL UTILITIY FUNCTIONS MUST INCLUDE UNIT TESTS**

When introducing new utilities, all directories should include an `index.js`, which exports to the
`index.js` of the `lib` directory.

`flow-typed` files should be included as needed and categorized between ones
written for npm packages, and ones written for GRAIL's custom utility functions.
